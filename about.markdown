I’m Ben, a french passionate coder. Here’s a little about me :

On the work side, I’m involved with many activities

- In 2014, I’ve co-founded [Washos](https://www.washos.com) an on-demand mobile car wash app that’s still up and running today.
- In 2019, I’ve joined my brother in Paris to “Digitalize” the family business. An e-commerce website selling spare parts.
- I’ve been teaching in many schools for the past 10 years around programming subject I really like, such as Web dev,
Testing, and even C/C++ (even though I’m pretty sure I couldn’t do that anymore!), but also digital marketing, 
traffic acquisition, etc.
- On top of the rest, I have my one-man agency where I like to take up on some clients to help them with their 
projects “v0”. I usually do 1 or 2 per year to challenge myself with different kinds of business.

I really appreciate the time spend running my two companies, even though it takes a lot of my time.
And when I don't work I enjoy the simple things, I'm fortunate enough to have amazing family and friends around with 
who I can spend quality time after work in the wonderful streets of Paris, enjoying your typical french wine&cheese.
 
On top of that, I'm a big soccer fan, I practice a lot and watch too much. My favorite team is Marseille and player is CR7,
don't judge me!
 
I'm also crazy about mechanical keyboards, own dozen of them. I just can't stop buying them.

I'm on twitter a lot, so if you want to chat, feel free to [hit me up](https://www.twitter.com/beNjiox).

Cheers,
