Hi ! I’m Ben, and welcome in my space!

Being confined in France right now makes me want to try a lot of stuff and blogging is one of them, hope you will like it!

For context, I’m a passionated french engineer who spend ~10 years building startups in the US (LA!) and I recently got back in France to be closer to my family and friends. I’m the co-founder of Washos, an on-demand car wash app and also partner at Adepem, a family business selling spare parts :) I’ve been doing Ruby and Rails for most of my web 
career, but decided to build Adepem with Laravel, and DAMN it’s good, honestly.

One of the reason it’s so good is the community, and that will make a good transition to the actual topic of this blog post, which will try to be a Digital Love Letter to Spatie.be
I personally don’t know anyone at Spatie, but from what I understand this is an agency ran by smart folks who happen to write exceptional open source packages for Laravel.

The reason I wanted to write about them is because I’m maintaining a pretty large e-commerce app written in Laravel, and as I was preparing our roadmap for Quarter 2, I’ve realised that most of our biggest next steps were going to be
made easier because… there is a Spatie package for that ™. (That’s literally what I’ve been telling my teammates during briefing). Basically…:

Wanna handle stripe webhooks in few lines of code? Check
Wanna build a MailChimp mailing list? No problem
Wanna log your models activities? Easy
Wanna create an ACL system for your team? Of course
Wanna build a sitemap? Don't get me started
Wanna make your code more robust and leverage some smart DTO? All right…

And I could honestly go on and on with the list. 
Not only what they provide just work, it’s also up to date with latest Laravel versions, heavily maintained, extremely well documented, bug free, fully tested. And if you actually don’t understand how something works, jump through the code and read it, you’ll get what they meant in seconds as the code is extremely always clear.

In their GitHub they say
> We invest a lot of resources into creating  [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source) . You can support us by  [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us) .

Man it’s not false advertising, it really is best in class.

So, if some Spatie members ever get to read this. THANK YOU for what you are doing. You are saving me, and my team probably months every year. 

And to support you, I’ve decided that for every package I pull in my projects, I will donate 5€ per months.
Let’s be clear, this is a ridiculous amount of money when compared to what it saves me, but at least this is something! 
We currently are using the following

```
“spatie/data-transfer-object": “^1.9”,
“spatie/laravel-activitylog”: “^3.14”,
“spatie/laravel-newsletter”: “^4.8”,
“spatie/laravel-robots-middleware”: “^1.2”,
“spatie/laravel-stripe-webhooks”: “^2.3”,
```

So that’s 5 (and probably more by the end of Quarter 2!), so you’ll get 25€ per month starting now from me.
And if you ever come to Paris, I’ll invite you all at my favorite pizzeria :)
Keep up the good work and thanks again!

Ben,
